Sample API code for public use by customers.


This is the endpoint accessed by external customers:

'https://papillon.area1security.com/'

This program assumes access credentials are present in these environment variables:

'A1S_USER_UUID'

'A1S_USER_PASSWORD'


If the output column ordering needs to be changed, try using 'csvcut' from
the csvkit (https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit)
